This is a (an API version of) Local Library written in Express.JS (Node.JS framework). We also use MongoDB database and Mongoose for querying the database.

The aim of this application is to demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations with one-to-many relationships between models. We have however, intentionally excluded user authentication/authorization.

Here is a link to the (recrafted from scratch) web version:
